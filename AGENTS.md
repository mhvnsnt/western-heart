## Owner's Agent Working Standard (mandatory, all agents)

Full standard: https://github.com/mhvnsnt/money-machine-hq/blob/main/docs/AGENTS.md. Read it before working here. The short version:

1. Do exactly what was asked. Ask when it's ambiguous. Never quietly swap in a cheaper or placeholder approach; call it out.
2. No faked progress. No "done/PASS/verified" without proof (PR link, test output, frames/screenshots you actually viewed).
3. Feature branch + PR for everything. **Never push WIP to `main`.** Merge only if it merges cleanly, CI passes, and it deletes/breaks nothing on main; otherwise leave the PR open.
4. Run gitleaks before every push. No secrets or personal info.
5. Build on existing work; don't redo or overwrite it. Finish before going wide.
6. Report failures first and honestly.
7. Owner's interests first: his money, his time, no advertising of unfinished games.
8. No copyrighted/leaked game files or third-party logos in public repos or Pages.
9. **Edit in place:** a fix or edit means opening the SAME existing project/file and changing it, with a git commit per change. Never regenerate from scratch unless asked. Keep one canonical project per work item at a documented path, with editable sources (EDLs, timelines, scripts, asset lists) next to renders.
10. **Log your workflow** in `WORKLOG.md` or `docs/workflows/`: what you did, the tools and settings, and the file paths.
11. Media deliverables follow Producerbot's `media-proof-standard` skill (check frames actually viewed; UNKNOWN is never PASS).

Self-check before saying "done": asked-scope met · shortcuts disclosed · proof attached · on a branch/PR · CI green · gitleaks clean · nothing copyrighted made public.
