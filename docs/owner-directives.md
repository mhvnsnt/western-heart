# Owner Directives — M.Dogg's standing orders for Western Heart

Living document. Updated every time the owner sets a directive. Newest first.

## 2026-10-22

- **Everything goes in the repo.** Every conversation — everything the owner
  says, everything the assistant says, all research — is saved into the repo
  every time: `docs/owner-directives.md`, `docs/research/`, `docs/decisions/`.
  Never wait to be asked.
- **Division of labor.** Owner does surgical hand-tooling (the parts AI
  struggles with — faster than 20 back-and-forths). Crew does automatic
  pulling, wiring, industry-standard open-source stack. Crew gets surgical
  only when asked. Owner wants to feel like a real game dev (Tekken studio /
  2K studio) doing non-code work: art direction, animation review, tuning,
  playtesting. No interest in learning to code.
- **Collaboration loop.** Crew ships a piece → it goes live on
  https://mhvnsnt.github.io/western-heart/ → owner reviews and hand-tweaks →
  crew runs industry-standard automation → shows result → repeat. All inside
  the customization suite, which is improved as a deliverable each round.
- **Round trip.** Suite gets a save/export button → owner tweaks, downloads a
  patch file, sends it in chat → crew validates and applies via PR. Suite can
  also load crew-staged tweak kits.
- **Tag-team community creations.** The owner + crew build like WWE Community
  Creations but two-way: two people in different places working on the same
  character, both involved — the feature WWE lacks.
- **Merge after every pass.** Clean merges into main, no clobbering either
  side (via `tools/git-merge/git_merge.py`).
- **No-stubs rule.** If it's in the repo, it's wired up and working. Audit
  regularly; stubs get finished or removed.
- **Tekken base first.** Full skinning pipeline (bind pose, heat-map skinning,
  rigging, boning) for every character/GLB. Perfect the Tekken base (skeletons,
  models, moves, customization) so everything built on top works.
- **Game feel.** Feels like Tekken, with extra physics — partial ragdoll
  inspired by Gang Beasts / Human Fall Flat / Mortal Kombat Royal Rumble.
  NOT fully ragdoll.
- **WWE 2K26.** Pull animations, code, physics — NOT models.
- **Tripo auto-intake.** New Tripo models get rigged ASAP to their character
  rig. First live intake: Torch Attire 3 "Bald eagle."
- **Torch Attire 3 is the reference piece.** Full jiggle set (breasts, belly,
  hips/ass, thighs, camel-toe); repaint painted-on clothing as skin with
  pores; full anatomy (areolas, clitoris, labia) from Scarlett/Madeline
  reference models; proof must include motion capture, not just stills. Once
  perfected here, the system rolls out to other models.
- **Character select rule.** Attires ladder into their fighter; an attire is
  NOT its own selectable model unless the owner explicitly said so
  (e.g. Yoshimitsu ladders into Phantom's attires).
- **Asset sourcing.** Ripped/ported models (Tekken extracts, SmutBase ports)
  are raw material — transform heavily into the Western Heart universe's own
  characters. Owner made this call; legal caution was given and acknowledged.
- **Master roadmap.** All movesets from Tekken teardowns + canon moves;
  Tekken-like character creation and select screens; 100% teardown of all
  Tekken games (then other games' teardowns); the game feels like all Tekken
  games combined + our own stuff on top, then turned proprietary.
- **Hardened Mind Within mode.** Tekken "Devil Within"-style mode; each
  character selectable with their own storyline; wave/tournament feel like
  Mortal Kombat Royal Rumble in places. All fighters rigged and working for
  it and all other modes.
- **No full game downloads.** Use `tools/depot-pull/` — pull only needed
  files piece by piece. Disk rules are mandatory for all agents.

## 2026-10-21

- All fixes by AI agents, no hand-tooling by the owner (later refined — owner
  now does surgical hand-tweaks in the loop).
- Model-quality round: fix Pantera weights, Doc Frank feet, root-cause the
  "backwards decrypt" in the pipeline (not per-model tweaks), Doc Frank
  attires Tripo-first ordering.
- `git_merge.py` saved to `tools/git-merge/` via PR #495 for merging clean
  green PRs without the GitHub merge API.

## DISPLAY ORDER LAW (2026-10-22, permanent)

Tripo 3D models show FIRST and foremost for every fighter; Tekken attires/models ladder BEHIND as back-slot attire choices.

**SOLE EXCEPTION: Pantera.** His Attire 1 is a King reskin, but the user already customized it, so it may show first/up front. He is the ONLY exception; every other fighter's Tekken reskins go later in the ladder. No future pass shall "fix" Pantera's attire order.
